***DIALOGUE
There are an array of plaques on the door. The largest and most central reads 'DAVID SNOPPER', with 'Associate Supervising Specialist Helper Attendant' in smaller text. Almost a hundred other plaques surround the nameplate aggressively and describe a number of municipal offices.
"MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION OF GARDENING"
"MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION OF PHONECALLS"
"MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATIONS"
And there, third column from the left on the second-bottom row:
"MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION OF PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE".
