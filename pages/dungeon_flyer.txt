***DIALOGUE
THE DUNGEON (tm) !!!
With every home purchased in Snortsville you get access to THE DUNGEON (tm) !!!, a network of tunnels and walkways built for the community.
- Perfect for storage
- Luxurious canals with running water*
- Every good wizard needs a dungeon
- Two to three cells per person

* Do not under any circumstances drink the running water from the luxurious canals.

You had forgotten about this place! Well, here it is again in all its dark glory. You recognise that this is more of a sewer than a dungeon, but much like the foyer you call it a dungeon anyway. The municipality made a big fuss about how they were investing in the public when this thing was built (or refurbished, you suspect).
Anyway, back to the stupid dungeon.
