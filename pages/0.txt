***DIALOGUE
Your name is Brogdan, and you are a very shitty wizard. You stand in the middle of a forest in an absent-minded stupor, wondering what it is you came out here for.
Looking around you spy to the west your Wizard's Tower, pointing crookedly to the sky out of the treeline. To the north and east are trails into the forest.
***CHOICES
1:Go west, back home.
2:Go north.
3:Go east.
IF:HAS_WAND:1:4:Cast a spell.
