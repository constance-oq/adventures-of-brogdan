***DIALOGUE
You get lost in the forest. A bear charges you. You flail around helplessly as you are mauled to death. Before you die the bear is polite enough to tell you how to quit the game.
"Type 'exit' and press enter to exit!" it growls.
You try to thank the bear but all that comes out is a pathetic blood gargle. You die.
***CHOICES
0: Come back to life anyway, and go back the way you came. The dev didn't implement dying yet...
