***DIALOGUE
You approach the troll. His name is Grod: this you piece together from the nametag proclaiming "HI! MY NAME IS: grod" pinned to his vest.
"It means 'soft and healthy soil'", he says, smiling a friendly smile at you. You don't really care but you smile awkwardly in return anyway. You feel like a dickhead.
Grod continues, "What can I do for you today, my friend?"
***CHOICES
troll_insult:"Oh, fuck you."
troll_let_me_past:"I'd like to get past, please."
